MSV000094781;We propose to elucidate new metabolic pathways in fungi - with a special focus on white rot fungi (WRF)- involved in the catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds. Basidiomycete fungi, in particular WRF, are the most efficient organisms for the depolymerization and mineralization of lignin to CO2 and H2O in Nature and thus, WRF play a pivotal role in carbon cycling. Lignin depolymerization by WRF is mediated by the action of extracellular oxidative ligninolytic enzymes, such as laccases and peroxidases, alongside other secreted metabolites. This extracellular process has been studied for decades via analysis of lignin modifications, ligninolytic enzyme activity in fungal broths, enzyme isolation and characterization, and more recently through multi-omics analyses. Despite the massive research effort directed toward understanding how WRF depolymerize lignin, almost no attention has been dedicated to the elucidation of the intracellular metabolism of WRF in catabolizing lignin. In fact, whether or not WRF are able to catabolize lignin remains a matter of discussion and debate.

MSV000094780;The earth’s climate is warming, and warming-induced biological feedbacks to climate threaten to further destabilize ecosystems. In a 30-year soil warming field experiment at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, microbial isolates from heated (+5 degrees C above ambient) show signs of irreversible adaptation to warming in traits associated with altered soil biogeochemical cycling. Our labs have documented physiological adaptation in all three dimensions of microbial activities: growth, resource acquisition, and stress tolerance. We will use metabolomics to investigate the nature of adaptation due to long-term warming, where reduced soil organic matter, reduced soil water holding capacity and potentially increased niche partitioning may be a selective pressure. Specifically we hypothesize that increased drought tolerance of Actinobacteria exposed to long-term warming is due to production of more or different compatible solutes compared to isolates from controls.

MSV000094763;Microbial chemoautotroph-heterotroph interactions may play a pivotal role in the cycling of carbon in the deep ocean, reminiscent of phytoplankton-heterotroph associations in surface waters. Nitrifiers are the most abundant chemoautotrophs in the global ocean, yet very little is known about nitrifier metabolite production, release, and transfer to heterotrophic microbial communities. To elucidate which organic compounds are released by nitrifiers and potentially available to heterotrophs, we characterized the endo- and exometabolomes of the ammonia-oxidizing archaeon Nitrosopumilus adriaticus CCS1 and the nitrite-oxidizing bacterium Nitrospina gracilis Nb-211. Nitrifier endometabolome composition was not a good predictor of exometabolite availability, indicating that metabolites were predominately released by mechanisms other than cell death/lysis. While both nitrifiers released labile organic compounds, N. adriaticus preferentially released amino acids, in particular glycine, suggesting that its cell membranes might be more permeable to small, hydrophobic amino acids. We further initiated co-culture systems between each nitrifier and a heterotrophic alphaproteobacterium, and compared exometabolite and transcription patterns of nitrifiers grown axenically to those in co-culture. Particularly, B vitamins exhibited dynamic production and consumption patterns in co-cultures, including a higher release of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) in both co-culture systems, and increased amounts of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and the vitamin B12 ligand dimethylbenzimidazole in co-cultures with N. adriaticus and N. gracilis, respectively. In contrast, the heterotroph likely consumed the vitamin B7 precursor dethiobiotin in co-culture with N. gracilis. Our results indicate that B vitamins and their precursors could play a particularly important role in governing specific metabolic interactions between nitrifiers and heterotrophic microbes in the ocean.

MSV000094574;"""Anti-aging"" supplements purported to contain nicotinamide based compounds were obtained from a variety of sources. Samples were extracted in a solution of 60% methanol at a 1:20 to 1:100 ratio based on pilot tests on solubilization of material. Extracts were clarified by high speed centrifugation, dried by speedvac and diluted to a 1:100 to 1:500 g/g ratio of the original material in 5% acetonitrile in LCMS grade water. Samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive Classic system coupled to a Dionex UHPLC using a 15cm x 2.1mm HyperSil gold column with 1.5um particles (Thermo, all). A 20 minute method with a data dependent top 3 method was used with each sample analyzed in triplicate, separately in each polarity. The output files were analyzed in Compound Discoverer 3.3 SP2 using a combination of libraries as described in the manuscript. Standards were obtained from MilliPore Sigma for Nicotinamide and derivatives for retention time matching and concentation estimations.

MSV000094091;The proposed project aims to elucidate the gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) underlying terpenoid metabolism in three major bioenergy crops, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), maize (Zea mays), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), to aid crop development for enhanced stress resilience and biofuel production from biomass feedstock. Prior studies identified more than 50 terpene synthases (TPS) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450), as key enzymes in generating bioactive terpenoids, in several bioenergy plants including switchgrass and maize. This knowledge now enables a precise investigation of the GRNs that govern common and species-specific terpenoid pathways. We will integrate transcription factor (TF) functional studies, TF binding site mapping, transcript and metabolite profiling, and terpenoid pathway engineering to identify the terpenoid-metabolic TF networks mediating stress responses in switchgrass, maize and sorghum.

MSV000094089;"Hybrid poplar (Populus alba?×?grandidentata; p39) wild type (WT) and QsuB transgenic low-lignin lines were previously described (Unda et al., 2022). WT and lines QsuB1, QsuB5, and QsuB15 were grown in a greenhouse as described in Lin et al., 2022. Samples for metabolomic analyses were collected after a growth period of six months. Stems were cut 5 cm above the root collar and segments of 5 cm were collected above the 1st (bottom), 20th (middle), and 40th (top) internodes. The bark was peeled and developing xylem tissue was collected by scraping the surface of the debarked segments using a razor blade. This approach generated developing xylem samples from the mature (bottom segment), intermediate (middle segment), and immature (top segment) parts of the stem. All the samples were immediately placed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at ?80 °C until time of use. Frozen samples were pulverized with a ball mill (Retsch) using stainless steel jars and grinding balls. Four biological replicates from each transgenic poplar line and WT control were used for metabolomic analyses. The data showed that some changes in metabolite abundance occur only in a specific tissue such as the xylem, phloem, or periderm. In the poplar line that exhibits the strongest reduction of lignin, we found that ~19% of the detected metabolite ions had different abundances in the xylem from mature stems. Changes affect predominantly the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways, secondary cell wall metabolism, and result in significant accumulation of hydroxybenzoates that derive from protocatechuate and salicylate.

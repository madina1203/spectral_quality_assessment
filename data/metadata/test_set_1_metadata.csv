MSV000094782;Part of the DOE’s strategy to ensure American energy independence is to produce biofuels from dedicated biomass crops. Achieving DOE’s ambitious goal of displacing 30 percent of 2004 gasoline demand with biofuels by 2030 will require major increases in plant productivity. Switchgrass has been championed as a promising bioenergy species, but few tools exist to facilitate its widespread commercial use. A major challenge has been its large, complex genome. As a close relative of agronomic switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) with a diploid genome and seed-to-seed time of 8 weeks, Panicum hallii offers researchers a model system for exploring Panicum genetics, genomics, and adaptation for agronomic improvement. Bacteria living in leaves and roots influence many aspects of plant health, especially rhizobacteria and mycorrhizae are known to impact plant aboveground phenotypes 1,2. To better understand P. halli-microbe ecosystems, we will conduct experiments at our Texas field site, in EcoCells at Desert Research Institute (DRI) and in growth chambers and the Ecopod at LBNL. Ecopods are enclosed environments that allow direct and intensive monitoring and manipulation of replicated plant-soil-microbe-atmosphere interactions over the complete plant life cycle. Specifically, we are interested in plant microbe ecosystem stress response with respect to soil drying. Despite its broad adaptation to marginal, droughty soils 3,4, a persistent issue in producing switchgrass has been the rapid and consistent establishment of strong stands, especially when drought occurs during implantation. The proposed study is aimed at disclosing biotic interactions modulating plant and microbial metabolism under globally relevant environmental conditions and provides an opportunity to benchmark the Ecopods at LBNL.

MSV000095207;Microbial consortia have a high relevance in natural environments. Here we present the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) from two agroindustrial wastes by a synthetic interkindom consortia formed by a saprotrophic fungus Ophiostoma piceae CECT 20146 which has a wide range os lignocellulolytic enzymes and a natural PHA producer, P. putida KT2440. The wastes used are Brewer’s Spent Grain (BSG) that acts as an scaffold for biofilm formation and source of carbon and nitrogen, and Waste Cooking Oil (WCO), which supplies a good carbon source for PHA production. Biochemistry, microscopy and omic (trasncriptomic and metabolomic) techniques are applied to understand physic, trophic and signalling interactions. Results show that the consortium accumulates up to 10.4 % of the total weight of the culture in form of PHA when the quorum sensing molecule, farnesol (naturally produced by O. piceae) is added, thanks to the increased proliferation of P. putida cells in this condition.   An interactive Shiny application has also been developed for an easy visualization and comprehension of all the trasncriptomic and metabolomic data, the application is available in the following link: https://jgf-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/Visualization_app/. These results show an induction of PHA synthesis machinery of P. putida in the consortium and that trophic interaction between the microorgranisms may rely in the citric acid produced by O. piceae and glycerol liberated from WCO, which can both be consumed by P. putida. Bioreactor scale-up experiments also lay the groundwork for the implementation of an industrial consolidated bioprocess (CBP).
